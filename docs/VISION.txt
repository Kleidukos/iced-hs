Welcome to iced-hs, a Haskell wrapper for iced Rust library!

This text exists to share a vision and goals of this
project. The main goal is to design the best api
for building UI applications. Haskell is here
for abstraction and composition, while being concise.
Rust provides the foundation via iced, brings
performance and access to crates.io. The api is inspired by
and continues the ideas of numerous projects such as:
- Elm and The Elm Architecture, https://elm-lang.org/
- iced, https://github.com/iced-rs/iced
- elm-ui, https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui
- elm-canvas, https://github.com/joakin/elm-canvas
- webgl, https://github.com/elm-explorations/webgl
- miso, https://github.com/dmjio/miso
- monomer, https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer

Best,
Ilya Baryshnikov and contributors
